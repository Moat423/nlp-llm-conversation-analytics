You invested in a memecoin of your own free will, no one forced you. Remember, some people made a fortune from OBOT during its early phase.

Regarding the merge, even if the team decides not to proceed, you have no say in it. Price fluctuations and crashes are part of the memecoin game. You never complain when you lose money on other memecoins, so why now?

The team is actively working to ensure the OBOT community isn't left behind, yet you're still complaining. Once the merge is complete, OI is expected to reach a $325 million market cap, meaning you'll break even. After that, it's up to you whether to hold OI or not.

Elon Musk, along with a group of investors, has made a $97.4 billion offer to acquire OpenAI. The proposal aims to bring OpenAI back to its original mission as a nonprofit organization focused on AI safety.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, swiftly rejected the offer and responded on the social network X, saying, 'No, thanks, but if you'd like, we'll buy Twitter for $9.74 billion.'

Musk and Altman co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit organization in 2015, but disagreements later arose between them.",2025-02-11T12:52:00Z,9789012345,Obot,Obot,
