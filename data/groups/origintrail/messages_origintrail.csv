2,"Isn't that only the case if the actor wants it to be 'right' that they can essentially update it?

Lets compare ChatGPT and ChatDKG. Say there is a ton of data being uploaded on DKG, along with tons of misinformation/false statements. Is there anything preventing ChatDKG from acting like GPT in that it can give false information? I believe DKG always has sources you can verify, but I think in practice it would be like wikipedia where everyone assumes what is written is true.",2024-03-05T23:27:00Z,2222222222,Vincel,Vincel,
3,"How do you know anything is correct? DKG is not about filtering the content or deciding what is correct or what is not, it's about creating a single repository with knowledge, where surely you will find both truthful and falseful statements, but there are few things to consider:

1. Falseful statements or misinformation is expensive to produce
2. You can have bunch of sources, which you can always compare
3. It's you who decides what is more likely to be true for you, same way as anything else in the World. DKG is a tool that makes finding your truth easier via structuring and gathering knowledge in one place",2024-03-05T23:58:00Z,3333333333,Anonymous,Anonymous,

All of the information it is publishing is public data (from financial reports that are easy to find online).  By using the DKG, my belief is that it makes chatanalyst's output fully verifiable, which is important if professionals are going to make investment decisions based upon chatanalyst's tools",2024-08-14T06:20:00Z,1111111146,Kool-Aid Man,Kool-Aid,Man

Consider public knowledge published on the DKG as a tip of an iceberg, with incomparably larger amounts of private data indexed publicly, connected to public knowledge, but protected from public viewing. The value of both the public data and private data is thus not merely established by the stand alone utility of each piece of knowledge, but rather a function of connectivity across tens of millions and in the future billions and more knowledge assets, both private and public .",2024-08-14T08:10:00Z,1111111147,≈Ωiga Drev - OriginTrail.io,≈Ωiga Drev,OriginTrail.io
